### About the Book
This book is intended for Cloud Operators and/or Infrastructure administrators who are adopting an OpenStack cloud and want to automate administrative functions using Ansible. The book can provide a two-for-one type of learning experience. First they would become familiar with how to handle Cloud Operator tasks (ie creating multiple users/tenants, creating host aggregates/AZ's, setting up Multi-Tenant Isolation, setting quotas, evacuating compute hosts for maintenance and etc). Also, the reader would become very familiar with how Ansible works and some of its best practices.
